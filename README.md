This repository contains implementations of algorithms from the book "Grokking Algorithms" in Java. The primary objective is to implement and explore the algorithms learned in the book as a way of solidifying understanding and enhancing learning. By coding these algorithms, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how to apply them in real-world programming tasks.

[Binary Search](https://github.com/jwvIyx/grokking-algorithms-implementations-in-java/blob/main/binarysearch/BinarySearch.java) - Implementation of the binary search algorithm, one of the most efficient ways to search in a sorted array.   
[Linear vs Binary Search](https://github.com/jwvIyx/grokking-algorithms-implementations-in-java/blob/main/binarysearch/BinaryVsLinear.java) - This comparison measures the execution time of binary search and linear search on a sorted array (while both algorithms work on sorted data, binary search is much faster for large datasets)
